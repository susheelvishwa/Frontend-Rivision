# Introduction

Arrays in programming are like containers that hold multiple values. They have built-in methods that allow you to perform various operations on the elements stored in the array. Here are some commonly used array methods along with examples and use cases:


These are just a few examples of the many array methods available in JavaScript. By understanding and utilizing these methods, you can perform a wide range of operations on arrays to manipulate and extract data efficiently.

# Conclusion

Arrays in programming are containers for multiple values, offering built-in methods for various operations. 
Methods like 
push() add elements to the end, 
pop() removes the last element, 
shift() removes the first, and 
unshift() adds to the beginning. Other methods like 
concat() merge arrays, slice() extract portions, 
indexOf() finds elements, 
includes() checks for existence, 
join() creates strings, and 
reverse() reverses the array. Additionally, 
splice() modifies arrays by removing, replacing, or adding elements. Coding challenges include tasks like summing array elements, filtering based on a target, finding averages, intersecting arrays, and sorting alphabetically.
