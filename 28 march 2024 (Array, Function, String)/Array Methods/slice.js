// The slice() method extracts a section of an array and returns a new array. It takes two arguments: the start index (inclusive) and the end index (exclusive). It's like cutting out a specific portion from a cake

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape'];
let citrusFruits = fruits.slice(1, 3);
console.log(citrusFruits);

// Use case: Selecting a specific range of elements from an array.
