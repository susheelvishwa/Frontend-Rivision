// The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array. It also updates the indexes of the existing elements. It's like adding new people to the front of a line

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
fruits.unshift('orange');
console.log(fruits);


// Use case: Adding new items to the beginning of a list.
