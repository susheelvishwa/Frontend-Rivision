// The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that element. It also updates the indexes of the remaining elements. It's like removing the first person from a line

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
let removedFruit = fruits.shift();
console.log(removedFruit); 
console.log(fruits); 

// Use case: Removing the first item from a queue.
