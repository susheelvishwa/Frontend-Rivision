# What is meant by local storage ?

> What do the words local storage mean ?
***Storing locally, right? Storing what ? ⇒ data or information. Storing where? ⇒ Locally ⇒ means where? On google drive? No. it’ll be stored on our browser where we will run the app. Local storage can be used to store data as a mini database or a local database.***

> What is meant by database?
***The collection of data or the place where the data is stored is called database. Similarly local storage is something where data can be stored locally but it is limited by size, that means large amount of data cannot be stored.***

> Now, let’s see how the data will be stored in the local storage? 
***It is stored in the form of key-value pairs but it is not an object because we cannot apply all object methods here.***


## Actual Definition: 
***localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.***

> When to use local storage ?
 <You should only use local storage when storing insensitive information, i.e., we cannot store passwords and some sensitive information.
 <Local storage can help in storing data temporarily before it is pushed to the server, i.e., we can’t store data permanantly.

 > Where to see the local storage ?
- <Open browser and click on inspect.
- <Click `Application` and inside that you can see `Local Storage`
- <That is where our data gets stored, we’ll see how to store and data and come back again here.

> What are the limitations ?
<Insecure data (data is not secured, it can be hacked, i.e., someone who can access your system can have the data)
<Synchronous operations (We’ll learn about it later)
<Limited storage capacity, i.e., images and videos cannot be stored, but we can store image and video urls.

> How does local storage work ?
<To use localStorage in your web applications, there are four methods to choose from:

-<setItem(): Add key and value to local storage*
-<getItem(): This is how you get items from localStorage*
-<removeItem(): Remove an item by key from localStorage*
-<clear(): Clear all local storage*

## Note : Local storage stores only strings, booleans and numbers.
What are the other data types we have ?
