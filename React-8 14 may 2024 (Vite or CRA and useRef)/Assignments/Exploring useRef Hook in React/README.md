# React useRef Examples with Vite

A React application built using Vite that demonstrates the use of the `useRef` hook for focusing an input field on mount, managing an uncontrolled input field, and interacting with a DOM element directly.

## Features

1. **Focusable Input Field**: Automatically focuses the input field when the component mounts.
2. **Uncontrolled Input Field**: Manages an uncontrolled input field and retrieves its value in real-time without using state.
3. **Interactive DOM Element**: Changes the background color of a DOM element when it is clicked.
