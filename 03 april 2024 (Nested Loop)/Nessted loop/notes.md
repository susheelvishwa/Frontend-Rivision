# Introduction
Nested loops are loops within loops, allowing for more complex iterations over data structures. They are commonly used when working with multi-dimensional arrays or nested data structures like arrays of objects. Understanding nested loops is crucial for iterating through complex data structures and performing operations on their elements.

# Detailed Explanation
Nested loops consist of one loop inside another loop. The inner loop will run completely for each iteration of the outer loop. This means that for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will run to completion.

# 2D Arrays
A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element of the outer array is itself an array. This forms a grid-like structure where elements are arranged in rows and columns.

# Array of Objects
An array of objects is an array where each element is an object. This is commonly used to represent a collection of related data, such as a list of products in an online store. Each object in the array may have multiple properties representing different attributes of the product.

# Conclusion
Nested loops are essential for working with complex data structures like 2D arrays and arrays of objects. They allow for efficient iteration and manipulation of elements within these structures. By understanding how to use nested loops effectively, programmers can write more versatile and powerful code.
